= Advanced Data Sources Configuration

There are some data sources which require further configuration, and others that have additional actions available for you to change how information is displayed.

* link:#WorkingWithExcelandGoogleSheets[Excel and Google Sheets], which have extra parameters for labels and automatic range selection.

* link:#WorkingwithCSVs[CSV files], for which date formats can be auto-detected by ReportPlus or identified depending on a specific date format.

* link:#WorkingWithFacebook[Facebook], with mandatory parameters which must be configured for the information to be displayed.

* link:#WorkingWithGoogleAnalytics[Google Analytics], with mandatory parameters which must be configured for the information to be displayed.

* link:#WorkingWithMicrosoftAnalysisServices[Microsoft Analysis Services], with mandatory parameters which must be configured for the information to be displayed. In addition, you have extra options for dashboard filters and sorting.

* link:#WorkingWithMicrosoftReportingServices[Microsoft Reporting Services], for which a specific render mode must be set.

* link:#WorkingWithTwitter[Twitter], with mandatory parameters which must be configured for the information to be displayed.

[#WorkingWithExcelandGoogleSheets]
== Excel and Google Sheets

When you create a dashboard with Excel as a data source, you can enter *parameters* to change how the information is displayed. You will find the fields in the Parameter Settings tab.

The available parameters are:

* *First row contains labels*. If unselected, the application will ignore the values in the first row.
* *Automatic range selection*. If unselected, you can manually select a custom cells range. This can be achieved by manually entering a range in the custom cell range field.

[#WorkingwithCSVs]
== CSV files

*Dates in CSV files are auto-detected and assigned with the corresponding type (Date, DateTime, and Time)*. On rare occasions, however, a date format might not be recognized as expected (e.g.: "dd/mm" identified as "mm/dd"). In those cases, a CSV parameter (DateFormat) can be used to set a specific date format only for the current file. 

Make sure you carefully consider the new date format to be used, as it will replace ReportPlus' auto-detection entirely, identifying as dates only the fields that are an exact match for the _DateFormat_ parameter.

* DIMENSIONS
* FEATURES

For more information on dimensions and features, please visit this link:https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms174527(v=sql.110).aspx[Technet article].

There is also a *Sort by Caption* option which defines whether the filter will be applied to the dimension’s labels or to the corresponding values.
