= How to Configure Data Sources

As mentioned in the Getting Started section, ReportPlus provides you with the opportunity to connect to different enterprise data sources to retrieve information. While there are no changes to be made on the server side, you will need to configure the Data Sources within ReportPlus to access the data. You can choose from any of the following options:

* *Analytics* (link:#GoogleAnalytics[Google Analytics]).
* *Content Managers* (link:#SharePointServer[SharePoint Server], link:#Dropbox[Dropbox], link:#GoogleDrive[Google Drive], link:#Box[Box], link:#OneDrive[OneDrive]).
* *CRM* or *Customer Relationship Managers* (link:#DynamicsCRM[Microsoft Dynamics CRM], link:#Salesforce[Salesforce]).
* *Datastores* (link:#MicrosoftAnalysisServices[Microsoft Analysis Services], link:#MySQL[MySQL], link:#Oracle[Oracle], link:#PostgreSQLServer[PostgreSQL Server], link:#MicrosoftReportingServices[Microsoft Reporting Services], link:#MicrosoftSQLServer[Microsoft SQL Server], link:#Sybase[Sybase]).
* link:multiple-data-sources[*Multiple Data Sources*]
* *Spreadsheets* (link:#ExcelCSVGoogleSheets[Excel, CSV or Google Sheets]).
* *Social* (link:#Facebook[Facebook], link:#Twitter[Twitter]).
* *Other* (link:#ODataService[OData Service], link:#WebResource[WebResource])

To configure any data source, you will need to complete the following steps:

1. *Access the Data Source Menu.* Click the blue _NEW DASHBOARD_ button on the top left corner.

[start=2]
2. *Navigate to the Create a New Data Source dialog.* You will be presented with the following menu:

image::images/ConfiguringDataSources/ChooseDataSourceMenu_Desktop.png[ChooseDataSourceMenu_Desktop]

In the top section of the screen, you will see a list of recently used Data Sources. To create a new one, click on the blue image:images/ConfiguringDataSources/NewDataSourceButton_Desktop.png[NewDataSourceButton_Desktop] button on the lower right section. You will be directed to the following screen:

image::images/ConfiguringDataSources/NewDataSourceDialog_Desktop.png[NewDataSourceDialog_Desktop]

[start=3]
3. *Select your Data Source*. Select the specific data source you wish to configure.

[start=4]
4. *Enter the details for your Data Source* and click Next. For specific information on the required information for each Data Source, navigate to the corresponding section.

5. *Click Connect*. You will then be able to access your information.

After creating and using your Data Source for the first time, you will see it displayed in the *Recent Data Sources* menu for future reference.

[#Box]
== Box

Upon clicking Box, you will see the following log in prompt.

image::images/ConfiguringDataSources/EnterBoxdetails_Desktop.png[EnterBoxdetails_Desktop]

Enter your login credentials and click "Authorize".

=== Supported Files

When working within ReportPlus, you will be able to use a wide variety of files:

=== Supported Files

When working within ReportPlus, you will be able to use a wide variety of files:

* *Spreadsheets*: Excel (.xls, .xlsx) or CSV, which you can use dynamically within ReportPlus.
* *Other files* (including images or document files such as PDFs, texts, etc.), which will be displayed in a preview mode only.

[#ExcelCSVGoogleSheets]
== Excel, CSV or Google Sheets

ReportPlus supports importing Excel (.xlsx, .xls), CSV files and Google Sheets to be used as data sources in the creation of dashboards.

Files can either be referenced from cloud storage, such as SharePoint, Google Drive, or Dropbox, or locally from your local drive. Using the cloud storage is recommended because it will allow you to access the data from any device on different platforms without needing to create multiple copies of the data file.

=== Using files from Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive or SharePoint

It is recommended to configure a connection to a shared file content repository such as SharePoint, Dropbox, or Google Drive. Once a connection has been configured, files available in these repositories can be added to the dashboard directly. In this case, the dashboard will keep a reference to the file and will reflect changes if the file is modified.

image::images/ConfiguringDataSources/EnterExceldetails_Desktop.png[EnterExceldetails_Desktop]

If you need to carry this file with you, there's always the option to *copy the file from the content repository to your Computer*. This ensures availability of the file in offline scenarios, or even the chance to create new dashboards with the local copy.

1. Choose *CSV/Excel* as your Data Source.
2. Click the *On my device* option from the list.
3. Select *your desired file*. You will see the following screen:

[start=4]
4. Select *the information you want to visualize*. You can choose to have a _Quick Look_ at your spreadsheet, select a specific _Sheet_, a _Named Range_, or a _specific range_ of cells.


You will then see a new widget appear in your dashboard with the information; by default, the visualization type will be a Grid View.

A web resource, as the name suggests, is any virtual file stored in the web which you can retrieve by using a unique URL address. It might, for example, be an excel spreadsheet (for example, link:http://www.exceldashboard.org/Northwind.xls[this one]), or an image (for example, link:http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/f2/4d/01/f24d01ca-1128-f5df-4c22-2e8df71e6704/screen640x640.jpeg[this one]).
